# EWasteApocalypse
This is a game that I made using Python x3 and Pygame. Here is a link to a demonstration of this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qBUurrIb_A

This game was made using Python 3.2.5 and Pygame 1.9.2.

If you check out my youtube video, you will see that there is music in my game. 
Unfortunately, I am not able to add the music file as it is too large, but you download the music manually
using the link I provided in the description of the video.

I hope you enjoy! 
P.S. If you beat my highscore, let me know :)
